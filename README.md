### SUMMARY ###

I am a Medior SW Tester with ISTQB certification. Precision, consistency, analytical thinking, and attention to detail are part of my DNA, which is why I chose a career path in QA within software development. I am well-organized and always see tasks through to completion. I am not afraid to make independent decisions and take full responsibility for assigned tasks. I am accustomed to high levels of responsibility and team leadership from my previous experience in marketing, where I managed million-euro budgets, met ambitious goals, and led multi-member teams. I am eager to learn, keep up with IT trends, and continuously develop my skills in testing, development, and AI. I am currently studying an AI course for developers and testers, and I plan to further expand my knowledge in Azure, Kubernetes, and security. Before my career in QA and testing, I gained many years of experience in marketing and PR for technology companies and sports brands (20 years). In addition to valuable knowledge from a number of IT courses, I can also draw on my extensive experience in marketing for IT/ICT companies, fintech and technology startups. Among other things, I managed a test lab and performed manual hardware testing. I participated in testing banking applications for Creative Dock (mutumutu, Qubic) and others.
