## SUMMARY ##

I am a Junior Manual Tester with ISTQB certification and many years of experience in marketing, who decided to change direction and embark on an adventure in the software testing and QA field. In addition to the newly charged experience from the intensive course by Coders Lab, I can draw on my many years of experience in marketing IT/ICT companies. Among other things, I managed the Test Lab and performed manual HW testing. Thanks to cooperation with development companies and startups, I know what Agile work entails, and Scrum and Kanban are not foreign words to me. Continuing education is a necessity in order to move further in the field, the same as in marketing, so I am currently at the beginning of my study of programming in Python.

Potential benefits from previous marketing experience:
 - Long-term experience with Test Lab management, manual HW testing (IT, ICT products), and writing technology reviews (10 years) 
 - Knowledge of working in development companies or in startups - experience with Agile/Scrum (5 years)
 - Cooperation on the creation of websites from scratch - cooperation on user scenarios, website copywriting, SEO (4 years)
 - Orientation in digital marketing, UX (4 years)
 - Orientation in IT thanks to long-term cooperation with IT/ICT companies and the need to constantly educate in the field.
