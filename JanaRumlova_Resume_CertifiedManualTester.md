### SUMMARY ###
I am a Medior SW Tester with ISTQB certification. Precision, consistency, analytical thinking and attention to detail are part of my DNA, which is why I chose a career path in QA within software development. I am well organized and always see tasks through to the end. I am not afraid to make independent decisions and take full responsibility for assigned tasks. From my previous work in marketing, where I managed budgets in the millions, met ambitious goals and led multi-member teams, I am used to a high level of responsibility and teamwork. I am eager to learn, keep up with IT trends and constantly develop my skills in testing, development and AI. I am currently studying an AI course for developers and testers and plan to further expand my knowledge in Azure, Kubernetes and security.  

Before my career in QA and testing, I gained many years of experience in marketing and PR for technology companies and sports brands (20 years). In addition to valuable knowledge from a number of IT courses, I can also draw on my extensive experience in marketing for IT/ICT companies, fintech and technology startups. Among other things, I managed a test lab and performed manual hardware testing. I participated in testing banking applications for Creative Dock (mutumutu, Qubic) and others.
